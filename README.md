# Gerrymander a Lattice model
This program generates a n x n lattice model with realistic population distributions and then gerrymanders the lattice model into a set of districts heavily favoring one party.
It uses simulated annealing and a couple of heuristics designed to help the algorithm use the packing strategy to gerrymander the lattice.
