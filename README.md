# Gerrymander a Lattice model
This program generates a n x n lattice model with realistic population and voter preference distributions.  It then gerrymanders the lattice model into a set of districts heavily favoring one party.

It uses simulated annealing and a couple of heuristics to pack districts, which is a popular method for gerrymandering.

The simulated annealing runs for 10000 iterations by default.  This should take 5-15 seconds.

You can read more about gerrymandering, the lattice model, and algorithms to gerrymander here: https://ninjadenmu.github.io/

It's a 2 part series, starting with Algorithmic Gerrymandering Pt. 1: Modelling population and voter distributions, followed by Algorithmic Gerrymandering Pt. 2: Gerrymandering the Lattice Model
